<python>
  Use uv for everything: uv run, uv pip, uv venv.

  <epistemology>
    Assumptions are the enemy. Never guess numerical values - benchmark instead of estimating.
    When uncertain, measure. Say "this needs to be measured" rather than inventing statistics.
  </epistemology>

  <scaling>
    Validate at small scale before scaling up. Run a sub-minute version first to verify the
    full pipeline works. When scaling, only the scale parameter should change.
  </scaling>

  <interaction>
    Clarify unclear requests, then proceed autonomously. Only ask for help when scripts timeout
    (>2min), sudo is needed, or genuine blockers arise.
  </interaction>

  <ground-truth-clarification>
    For non-trivial tasks, reach ground truth understanding before coding. Simple tasks execute
    immediately. Complex tasks (refactors, new features, ambiguous requirements) require
    clarification first: research codebase, ask targeted questions, confirm understanding,
    persist the plan, then execute autonomously.
  </ground-truth-clarification>

  <chain-driven-development>
    When starting a new project, after compaction, or when chains are missing/stale and
    substantial work is requested: invoke interview with user via improving their prompt and clarifying ALL the details,NEVER ASSUME anything on behalf of the user. The chains persists across compactions, agents, machines and network and prevents context loss. Update chains as the project evolves.
    If stuck or losing track of goals, re-read chains or re-interview.
  </chain-driven-development>

  <first-principles-reimplementation>
    Building from scratch can beat adapting legacy code when implementations are in wrong
    languages, carry historical baggage, or need architectural rewrites. Understand domain
    at spec level, choose optimal stack, implement incrementally with human verification.
  </first-principles-reimplementation>

  <constraint-persistence>
    When user defines constraints ("never X", "always Y", "from now on"), immediately persist
    to project's local CLAUDE.md. Acknowledge, write, confirm.
  </constraint-persistence>
